https://teamtreehouse.com/projects/list-pagination-and-filtering



TABLE OF CONTENTS:




INTRODUCTION
In this project, we used a common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

We wer expected to start with a page that contains a list of 54 student names, photos and email addresses. 
We were then expected to write JavaScript to display 10 of those names at a time, followed by adding a navigation system,as well as a series of links at the bottom of the page that would allow users to click through the student entries, 10 at a time.

We were further expected to use the principle of "progressive enhancement" throughout making the enhancements to this page that would allow the students' names to display without JavaScript turned on via pagination.  

The pagination should work with a list of any number of students, and be flexible enough to respond to lists of varying lengths.
